=== Welcome ===

Warm fuzzy feeling. About JellyBOX. About this guide. About you.

If you're building from scratch, we highly recommend you go with the flow in the suggested order. We spent countless hours testing and revising the build flow to balance ease of build with efficiency and just-in-time advice.

=== Workspace Setup === 

An organized workspace will 
* make the build more enjoyable. You can focus on the build instead of searching for tools 60% of the time
* make it all go faster
* reduce the potential for breaking things and making mistakes

''(True story: we have had a maker burn his control electronics because a stray screwdriver shorted the contact on the back of the board. A high price for mess on the table.)''
